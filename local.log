  -f, --folder               Specify the Local folder to be used for testing. This option is to be used when testing a local folder. Example: /home/ubuntu/mysite/ or C:\windows\mysite\
  -h, --help                 Display the help text.
  -V, --version              Display the current version of the binary.
  -F, --force                Using this option kills all other instances of BrowserStack Local binary running on this machine with the same --local-identifier options. This option will not affect binaries running in remote servers and instances running with different --local-identifier options.
