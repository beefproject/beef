	<p class="title">About</p>
	BeEF is a browser exploitation framework. Its  purpose in life is to 
	provide an easily integratable framework to demonstrate the impact of 
	browser and Cross-site Scripting issues in real-time. The modular 
	structure has allowed the development of new modules to be a simple process.

	<p class="title">What's New</p>
	You will immediately notice the log summary on the main screen. This logs zombie details and module 
	results. It provides access to the zombie pane by clicking on the date. There are two other 
	logs - the zombie log and the raw log. The raw log contains more information than the log summary 
	pane. For more detail refer to the CHANGELOG file.<br><br>
	 
	Changes Summary:<br>
	* Integration with Metasploit via XMLRPC<br>
	* New browser functionality detection modules<br>
	* Command interface support added for Safari<br>
	* Tiered logging for module actions and results<br>
	* Viewing page content added to the zombie pane<br>
	* Set Autorun support added to each module<br>
