# BeEF Manual Testing Plan (Local VM Edition)

This document provides a simplified approach for manually testing BeEF modules entirely within the same Linux Ubuntu VM where BeEF is running.

## 1. Environment Setup (Local VM)

### 1.1 BeEF Server
1.  **Dependencies**: Already installed via `./install`.
2.  **Configuration**: Credentials have been updated in `config.yaml`.
3.  **Launch**: Run `./beef` from the repository root.
4.  **Access**: Open the local browser (e.g., Firefox) and navigate to the BeEF UI: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel`.

### 1.2 Hooked Browsers (Local)
For local testing on the same machine:
1.  Open a new tab or window in your browser (Firefox, Chromium, etc.).
2.  Navigate to the hook demo page: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/demos/butcher/index.html`.
3.  The browser will appear in the BeEF "Online Browsers" list as `127.0.0.1`.

## 2. Testing Strategy: Firefox First

1.  **Primary Browser (Firefox)**: Use Firefox for **all** modules listed in Section 3.1.
    *   This list includes every module compatible with Firefox or "ALL" browsers.
2.  **Secondary Browser (Chrome/Safari/Edge)**: Use a secondary browser *only* for modules in Section 3.2.
    *   These are modules that explicitly identify as working in Chrome/Safari/Edge but *not* Firefox.
3.  **Skip Legacy**: Modules not listed in Section 3 are incompatible with modern browsers (e.g., IE-only, old Java/Flash exploits) and should be skipped.

### 2.1 Execution Procedure
1.  **Select Hooked Browser**: Click on your **Firefox** hook (or secondary browser for List 3.2).
2.  **Find Module**: Search for the module name in the BeEF "Commands" tab.
3.  **Read Instructions**: Follow the guidance in the **Instructions** column below.
4.  **Execute**: Click "Execute" and verify the "Command History".
5.  **Cleanup**: Perform any cleanup actions (e.g., clear cookies, close tabs) listed in the **Cleanup Needed** column.

## 3. Module Inventory and Instructions


### 3.1 Primary Test List (Firefox)

The iframe follows the mouse, so anywhere the user clicks on the page will be over x-pos,y-pos. The optional JS configuration values specify local Javascript to exectute when a user clicks, allowing the page can give visual feedback. The attack stops when y-pos is set to a non-numeric values (e.g. a dash).

| **Create Pop Under** | 1. Configure: `Clickjack`<br>2. Click Execute.<br><br>_This module creates a new discreet pop under window with the BeEF hook included.  Another browser node will be added to the hooked browser tree.  Modern browsers block popups by default and warn the user the popup was blocked (unless the origin is permitted to spawn popups).  However, this check is bypassed for some user-initiated events such as clicking the page. Use the 'clickjack' option below to add an event handler which spawns the popup when the user clicks anywhere on the page. Running the module multiple times will spawn multiple popups for a single click event.  Note: mobile devices may open the new popup window on top or redirect the current window, rather than open in the background._ | Close tab/window. Check for residual pop-unders. |

Click Execute.<br><br>_This module abuses window.location.opener to hijack the opening window, replacing it with a BeEF hook and 100% * 100% iframe containing the referring web page. Note that the iframe will be blank if the origin makes use of a restrictive X-Frame-Origin directive.  This attack will only work if the opener did not make use of the  noopener  and  noreferrer  directives.
