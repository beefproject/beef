Installation
------------

   1. Prerequisites (platform independent)
   2. Prerequisites (Windows)
   3. Prerequisites (Linux)
   4. Prerequisites (Mac OSX)
   5. Install instructions
   6. Run instructions



   1. Prerequisites (platform independent)

      BeEF requires Ruby 2.2+ and the "bundler" gem. Bundler can be installed by:

      gem install bundler

      
   2. Prerequisites (Windows)

      Windows is no longer supported. The following instructions are outdated.

      !!! This must be done PRIOR to running the bundle install command !!!
      
      Windows requires the sqlite.dll.  Simply grab the zip file below and extract it to your Ruby bin directory:

      http://www.sqlite.org/sqlitedll-3_7_0_1.zip

      Other than that, you also need TheRubyRacer. As it's painful to install it on Windows, you can download 2 pre-compiled V8 DLLs and 2 gems from https://github.com/eakmotion/therubyracer_for_windows.

      Finally, edit beef's gem lock file by replacing the required ruby racer version with the version downloaded from the link above. 

   3. Prerequisites (Linux)

      !!! This must be done PRIOR to running the bundle install command !!!

      On linux you will need to find the packages specific to your distribution for sqlite.  An example build script for Ubuntu 14.04 systems is:

        # Set your prefered build dir
        BUILDDIR=/opt && \
        cd $BUILDDIR && \
        \
        # Install dependences
        sudo apt-get update && \
        sudo apt-get install -y \
            build-essential \
            git \
            libsqlite3-dev \
            software-properties-common \
            sqlite3 \
            sqlite3-doc && \
        \
        # Add brightbox ppa for the latest version of ruby
        sudo apt-add-repository -y \
            ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng && \
        \
        # Install ruby (2.2 in this example)
        sudo apt-get update && \
        sudo apt-get install -y \
            ruby2.2 \
            ruby2.2-dev && \
        \
        # Install bundler using gem
        sudo gem install bundler

      3.1. It is recommended not to use rvm. If you use rvm the ruby binaries are installed to locations outside of your default path which may cause problems later.
  
   4. Prerequisites (Mac OSX)
   
      - XCode: provides the sqlite support BeEF needs
      
      - Ruby 2.1
      	To install RVM and Ruby 2.1.5 on Mac OS:
      	$ bash -s stable < <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer) source ~/.bash_profile
      	$ rvm install 2.1.5
        $ rvm use 2.1.5


   5. Install instructions
   
      Obtain application code either by downloading an archive from https://github.com/beefproject/beef/archive/master.zip or cloning the GIT repo https://github.com/beefproject/beef.git

      Enter into the newly created BeEF directory, and type:

      bundle install

      Bundler installs all the pre-requisite gems.

   6. Run instructions

      Simply run:

      ./beef -x
