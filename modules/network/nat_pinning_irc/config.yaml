            description: "Attempts to open closed ports on statefull firewalls and attempts to create pinholes on NAT-devices.  The firewall/NAT-device must support IRC connection tracking.  On the attackers side the TCP connection just needs to be accepted (nc -l -p 6667).  Then you can connect to the victims public IP on that port.  For more information, please refer to: <a href='http://samy.pl/natpin/'>http://samy.pl/natpin/</a> ."
